About the code
=================

This program implements the relationship between a shopper, a shopping cart 
and the checkout clerk

The Shopper has a shopping list called StufftoBuy. In the main program (CH10Q2.cpp)
the shopping list is opened and the item name, price and required quantity are read 
and placed in the cart. The checkout clerk scans the item, reports their names and
price then applies a 5% sales tax to the total. The shopper pays and writes the 
amount of money in his wallet before and after the shopping experience.
